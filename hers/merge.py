# 👩 HERS: Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for
#          Risk-Specific Vehicle Damage Adaptation
#          in Diffusion Models

#
# Description:
#   This script is part of the official implementation of HERS,
#   a self-supervised framework for adapting text-to-image diffusion
#   models to generate semantically faithful, risk-aware vehicle
#   damage images for safety-critical domains such as auto insurance.
#
#   HERS trains domain-specific LoRA experts from automatically
#   generated image–text pairs and merges them into a unified
#   diffusion model without manual annotation or inference-time routing.
#
# Disclaimer:
#   This code is released for research, reproducibility, and
#   fraud-awareness purposes only. Any deployment in real-world
#   insurance systems must comply with legal, ethical, and
#   regulatory requirements.
